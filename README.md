Two different examples of scraping from a stock market indices are provided. The first one scrapes from *Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange* (KLSE) and the second one scrapes from *Singapore Exchange* (SGX). To see the scrape for KLSE, simply navigate to the `KLSE` branch, and similarly do the same to see the scrape for SGX.
